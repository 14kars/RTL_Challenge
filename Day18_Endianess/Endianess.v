/*
So Why Does Everyone Have It Backwards?
However counter-intuitive it might seem at first, there are valid reasons why little-endian
is used over big-endian. The reason for the widespread use of little-endian is not because
of the ease of user understanding (as you might have figured out), but rather for ease of
the computer. Letâ€™s take a look at why. We will use this 8-byte value 0x0000000000000042.

When we store it in little-endian we have the following.
0x00: 42 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

and in big-endian we would get.
0x00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 42  */
