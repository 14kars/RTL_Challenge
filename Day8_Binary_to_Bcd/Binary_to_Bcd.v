/*here, module called "binary_to_bcd" has an 8-bit input signal called "IN" and three 4-bit output signals called "bcd0",
"bcd1", and "bcd2". The output signals are registers, which means they can be assigned values using the "always" block.
Integer variable called "n". It will be used as a loop counter in the following "always" block.
An "always" block that triggers whenever there is a change in the input signal "IN". It initializes the output 
signals "bcd0", "bcd1", and "bcd2" to 0.
The "for" loop  iterates from 0 to 7 (inclusive). It uses the "n" variable as a loop counter.

Code block checks if any of the output signals "bcd0", "bcd1", or "bcd2" is greater than 4. If any of them is greater than
4, it adds 3 to that signal.This is because the BCD code only allows numbers between 0 and 9, so any number greater than 4
needs to be corrected.

Then the code block assigns a 3-bit binary value to "bcd0", "bcd1", and "bcd2" based on the value of "IN[7-n]". It does
this by using a Verilog construct called a concatenation, which groups multiple variables or values together.

At each iteration of the "for" loop, the "bcd0", "bcd1", and "bcd2" signals are updated based on the value of the 
corresponding bit in the "IN" input signal. The least significant bit of "IN" (IN[0]) is assigned to "bcd0", the next 
least significant bit (IN[1]) is assigned to "bcd1", and so on. This process generates a 3-digit BCD code for the input 
binary number.

Overall, this Verilog code implements a binary to BCD converter. It converts an 8-bit binary number to a 3-digit BCD code 
using a "for" loop and some conditional statements to correct the output if any of the digits is greater than 4.*/
