/*Here,The module called "parity_encoder" that takes in a 16-bit input signal (x) and generates single-bit output 
signal (y). function called "parity_x" that takes in two input signals (a and b) and computes their exclusive 
OR(XOR) to determine their parity. The result of the XOR operation is stored in a variable called "parity_x".

This is a generate block that generates 16 parity_x functions and wires them together to compute the parity of the
entire 16-bit input signal. The "genvar" statement declares a variable i that is used to loop through the 16 bits 
of the input signal. The "reg" statement declares a 17-bit register called "temp" that is used to store the results 
of the parity computations.
The "for" loop iterates over the 16 bits of the input signal, and for each bit, it uses an "always" block to 
compute the parity of the previous bits (stored in "temp[i]") and the current bit of the input signal (x[i]). 
The result of each parity computation is stored in the next bit of the "temp" register (temp[i+1]).

Overall, this code is a compact implementation of a parity encoder that uses a generate block to create multiple 
instances of a parity function and wires them together to compute the parity of a larger input signal. */
